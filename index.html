<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
    <b>
I am a student who is deeply interested in computers, programming, and understanding how things work under the hood. 
I enjoy learning by building — whether it is writing Python programs, solving data structure problems, or creating small projects like this website to understand how the web actually functions. 
I am especially curious about areas like full stack development, data science, and artificial intelligence, and I like exploring how these fields connect with each other rather than treating them as separate boxes.
</p>
<p>
I believe learning is not about memorizing tools, but about understanding patterns, logic, and systems, which is why I spend a lot of time debugging, asking questions, and experimenting with code. 
I enjoy thinking critically about problems, improving my solutions step by step, and slowly turning confusion into clarity. 
That process — moving from “this doesn’t make sense” to “now I see it” — is something I genuinely enjoy.
</p>
<p>
I am still early in my journey, but I care about building strong foundations, writing clean and understandable code, and developing the ability to reason clearly about complex problems. 
This portfolio is a simple reflection of that mindset — starting small, building clean structures, and growing from there with patience and curiosity.
